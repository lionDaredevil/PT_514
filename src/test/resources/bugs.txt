1. Issue found in getColor method; works properly with input data "BLUE" only and does not work correctly with any other value.
The reason is that method returns value "BLUE" instead of variable.
2. Issue found in write method - inkContainerValue parameter increases in case when negative sizeLetter value set;
Works properly with sizeLetter >= 0, if sizeLetter < 0, after write method work increases, but should not change.
Bug occurs due to lack of sizeLetter value validation - in reality negative value can not be applied to letter size.
3. Issue found in write method - spaces are not excluded while ink consumption counting;
Works fine if input data does not contain spaces, if input string contains spaces, result will be incorrect.
Additional validation should be added - if space -> no ink waisted should be.
Proposed solution: add regexp to exclude spaces in string before pass this string into method.
4. Issue found in write method - text will be written if size of letters is 0;
Works properly if sizeLetter > 0, failed with sizeLetter = 0.
Bug occurs due to sizeLetter variable validation is absent.
5. Issue found in write method - sizeLetter < 0 may be passed into method and input string will be written entirely;
Method works properly if sizeLetter > 0 and if sizeLetter < 0 - fails.
Bug occurs due to sizeLetter variable validation is absent.
Proposed solution: it should be prohibited to pass negative values into sizeLetter variable.
6. Issue found in write method - incorrect string result returns, output string does not proportionally decreases when size of letters
increases;
Method works correctly when sizeLetter == 1.0, bug replicates in cases sizeLetter < 1.0 and ink volume is not enough to write
the entire word.
The reason is that due to condition in method, part of output word length will always equal inkContainer value.
